A bit of chess-related programming not quite ready for deployment.

A bit of documentation on some callbacks is provided by running "python3 gui.py -h". 

Keyboard shortcuts can be changed (for future instances of the program) by running "python3 set_keyboard_shortcuts.py".

Warning: Engines are set up to take a lot of memory by default.
